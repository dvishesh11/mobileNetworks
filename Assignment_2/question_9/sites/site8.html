    <h1>Footi Kothi</h1>
    <p>The building was originally commissioned by Tukojirao Holkar II (1844-1886). It was considered to have been planned by the Holkars to possibly rival the British; they wanted a more elaborate version of the British Residency at Mhow (presently Dr Ambedkar Nagar) in eastern Indore. According to an archaeologist, Dr D.P. Pandey, the British officer deployed at the Residency had banned the completion of the building upon getting wind of its purpose [4] [5]. Others say that the Kothi was conceived to eventually secure Indore from the British Army [6]. The palace was originally to be called Shirpur Kothi or Shirpur Palace, presumably for its proximity to the Sirpur Lake [7]. Although construction was paused in 1902, attempts were made to complete the building later. In 1903, the architect C.F. Stevens was given the assignment of finishing construction by Tukojirao Holkar III (1903-1926) [8].

    In the 1910s, the British architect Ernest George and the Scottish architect Alfred Yeates drew up a design of what the palace would have looked like had it been completed with additional renovations; these sketches reveal the original plan of the grandeur intended for the building, housing in the existing completed portion of the building the ground floor, and adding plans for housing for the Maharajaâ€™s staff [9]. The sketch also exhibited the heavy European influences on the architecture, with the Kothi being designed in Renaissance style, with arched verandahs and pedimented pavilions. The architects further added the proposed Durbar Hall to the plan, which would have measured 110x50 feet, with domestic rooms forming wings on either side of the hall, along with a zenana (enclosed area for women) and nursery, each equipped with a private garden [10].</p>
