    <h1>Lal Bagh Palace</h1>
    <p>Another one of the prominent historical places in Indore is the Lal Bagh Palace, a grand building which once served as the residence of the Holkar rulers. Built in 1886-1921 by Maharaja Shivaji Rao, this beautiful three-storied edifice is located on the banks of Khan River. The building features a grand entrance, a garden of roses, regal artwork by Indian and Italian artists, and an exquisite ballroom. The ornate d√©cor and interiors of Lal Bagh Palace, complete with beautiful wall carvings, chandeliers, rich carpets, and marble floors, will leave you awestruck.

    Today, the palace is converted into a museum where you can see an interesting range of artifacts. Needless to say, a visit to this magnificent palace which spreads over 28 acres is one of the best things do in Indore.</p>
